##### *Hidden Figures is one of my favorite movie of all time. Everytime that I need motivation, I rewatch this movie and still feel as if it was new as when I first watched it.* 

### **The story goes like this:** 
##### *Three brilliant African-American women at NASA -- Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson -- serve as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, a stunning achievement that restored the nation's confidence, turned around the Space Race and galvanized the world.*
